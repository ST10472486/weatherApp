My design choices use moody, weather-themed visuals and color gradients to convey the emotional feel of the day, rather than just the temperature. Large icons,
clear typography, and a horizontal forecast allow users to quickly grasp current conditions and upcoming trends, while the Celsius/Fahrenheit toggle hints at personalization, 
appealing to style-conscious urban explorers seeking both utility and aesthetic experience.
